# React Components (tailwind)

This repo is a bunch of useful react components found commonly across the internet. Due to their popular use, I though it might be useful for anyone who wants to add one to their site. Feel free to use any components if you like them but please try to credit this repo. I tried to make these as modular as I could and included some documentation to help beginners.
